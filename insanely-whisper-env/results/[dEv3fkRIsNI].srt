1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
We're going to head straight to the Vatican.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,120
My colleague Marion Machiri is standing by, Marion.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,280
Lewis, thank you very much indeed.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,120
Yes, welcome to the Vatican,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,800
where Pope Leo XIV has been celebrating mass

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,880
with cardinals at the Sistine Chapel

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,240
following his election on Thursday.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,040
These are the recent pictures of the new pope

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,480
entering the Sistine Chapel leading his first mass as pontiff.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,840
He began his homily in English,

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,600
saying he knew he could rely on every cardinal

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,800
to walk with him on his new mission.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,840
The pope has said the church must do more work

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,800
in places where there is a lack of faith

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,720
and said that he hopes his election

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,280
can help the Catholic Church

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,280
bring light to the dark nights of this world.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,840
Well, Pope Leo will be the 267th occupant

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,360
of the throne of Saint Peter.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,640
So what do we know about the first American

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,600
to fill the role of pope?

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,800
Well, 69-year-old Pope Leo XIV

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,320
was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,080
to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent.

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
He was ordained in 1982

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,640
and moved to Peru three years later.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,680
He then became a naturalised Peruvian citizen

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,680
spending 10 years as a local parish pastor

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,080
and teaching at a seminary in northwestern Peru.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,360
He became well-known to cardinals in the Vatican

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,200
because of his high-profile role

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,160
as prefect of the Dicastery for bishops.

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,920
Pope Francis made him the bishop of Checleo in Peru in 2014

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,360
and then he became archbishop in January 2023.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,520
Within a few months, Pope Francis had made him a cardinal.

36
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Well, joining me here is Anna Rowlands,

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
professor of Catholic social thought and practice

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,040
at Durham University,

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,080
who's been on succumbment to the Vatican for two years.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,760
And I have to say, you met the new pope last night.

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,880
What was that like?

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
I did, which was a surprise and an accident.

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,520
How was it an accident?

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,360
How does one meet the pope accidentally?

45
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,080
Well, my colleague, who's a very senior woman in the Vatican,

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,600
one of the most senior women in the Vatican

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,960
to be appointed by Pope Francis,

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,640
was charging at high speed across St Peter's Square

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,480
and I bumped into her and she said to me, run.

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
And I said, why?

51
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,160
And she said, just run.

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,360
So at that point I realised I was following her back

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,200
to the palazzo that's just behind where we're talking now

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,960
and that's where she lives in one of the apartments

55
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,760
and where the former Cardinal Prevost lived as well.

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
So rather sweetly, just as Pope Francis had gone back

57
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,720
to pay his bill at the guest house just after he became pope,

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,640
Pope Leo XIV went back to the community

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,800
in the palazzo where he lives to greet people personally,

60
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,720
to give them a blessing and to spend a little time,

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
to spend a little time talking.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
There you are.

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,400
That's sister Natalie as well.

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
There you are speaking to him.

65
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,440
And what did he say to you?

66
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,360
So, well, I had a chance to congratulate him

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,080
and also to assure him of prayers,

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,680
but also to thank him in particular for the powerful words

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
that he spoke from the balcony

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,480
and to express the gratitude on behalf of the crowd.

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
So many of that crowd would have loved

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
to have had the chance that I had last night

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,600
to greet him personally.

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,320
So I felt responsible to bring him the gratitude

75
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,640
and the joy of that crowd.

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
What were the powerful words

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
that stuck out for you from last night?

78
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,800
So peace, nine times he mentioned the word peace

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,120
and he wants to be a peace builder, a bridge builder,

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,080
he said, both for the church,

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,560
whether a divisions in the church, but also for the world.

82
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,760
The second key message was love,

83
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,480
the completely unconditional love of God for all people.

84
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,080
And he talked about bringing peace and love

85
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,320
for the whole of humanity, but also for the whole earth.

86
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,880
So that message very much from Benedict and Francis

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,480
that's focused on our climactic situation

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,480
as well as our kind of human situation of brokenness.

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,720
So I think he wants to focus on peace building

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,480
on a kind of unifying project, overcoming polarization

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,680
and to be basically a pope of a just peace for our times.

92
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
Will he succeed given the geopolitical headwinds,

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,320
given the way in which the Catholic church

94
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,200
has been moving over the last few years?

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, I think that there's a very good chance he will.

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,880
He came out dressed like Benedict, speaking like Francis.

97
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,960
That was the first sign of, I think,

98
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,120
his unifying mission to thread together,

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,000
literally in the threads he was wearing,

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,360
to thread together these papacies.

101
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
And I think that for the church

102
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,240
is very significant as a sign for the world,

103
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,360
also an important sign.

104
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,960
His first visit, as I understand it,

105
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,920
outside the Vatican will be to the Regina Chaly prison

106
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
just down the road from here.

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,280
Interesting.

108
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah, he's an Augustinian,

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,800
so he brings that focus on intellectual life,

110
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,080
but also service of the poorest and the most marginalized.

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,560
That is a heady, literally, combination.

112
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,520
And I think very interesting to have an Augustinian pope

113
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,240
for a moment when, as we saw the other month,

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,880
JD Vance quoting St. Augustine on Christian nationalism.

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
What will an Augustinian pope say to an Augustinian moment?

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
Well, what indeed.

117
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,680
Anna, it's a pleasure to talk to you.

118
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Thank you very much for sharing your photos as well.

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
Not at all.

120
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,760
You and Pope Leo XIV.

121
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,360
Now, let me just, if I may, show viewers at home

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,600
some of the Italian newspapers from this morning.

123
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,200
And unsurprisingly, all of them showing

124
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,720
the new pope on the front page.

125
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,280
This is Il Giornale, Leone d'America,

126
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,080
The Lion of America, a play on the pope's name.

127
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,080
La pace sia con te.

128
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
I don't know if you can see that

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,760
from the Avenida publication.

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,520
Peace be with us.

131
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,360
Sorry, con noi.

132
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
La pace sia con noi.

133
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,640
Peace be with us.

134
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,960
And here we have La Stampa.

135
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Il Papa dei Due Mondi.

136
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,680
The pope of two worlds.

137
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,760
And I think a reference there to the fact

138
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,960
that Pope Leo is American-born, North American-born,

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
but also a naturalized Peruvian citizen.

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
So also has strong connections with Latin America.

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,600
And finally, La Repubblica.

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,960
Il Papa Americano, the American pope.

143
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,600
Absolutely brilliant front pages there.

144
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,360
All of them showing Pope Leo XIV on that balcony.

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,640
Well, Louis Prevost is the brother of Pope Leo.

146
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,920
He's spoken about the moment he found out

147
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,200
his sibling was the new head of the Roman Catholic Church.

148
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
Have a listen.

149
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,680
It was like, oh my God, it's Rob.

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
It's never gonna be the same.

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,160
What are we gonna do?

152
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Yes, it's Rob, yeah, yeah.

153
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,080
I used to, I still do it, you know?

154
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Play with guns, knives, bolts and arrows.

155
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,040
He would play priest.

156
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,320
How boring, come on, Rob, let's go.

157
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,400
No, can I give you communion?

158
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,400
And we'd just teach him, you're gonna be the pope.

159
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
You wanna be the pope.

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,240
Here we are today.

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,320
He knew from an early stage he wanted to be a priest.

162
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,400
And he did.

163
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,320
Got out of grammar school, went right to the seminary.

164
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,640
He was always like a servant to the people,

165
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,280
trying to help the people build churches down there

166
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
and schools.

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,520
He's more down the middle.

168
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,280
Okay, let's see how we can take what Francis did,

169
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,040
massage it a little bit.

170
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,640
As pope now, he's just reinforcing the fact

171
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,640
that God and Jesus said, follow me and you'll be saved.

172
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,880
You'll be saved, evil will not win.

173
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,920
That's the brother of Pope Leo XIV.

174
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,160
And the mood, the atmosphere here in the Vatican

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,600
is one of such hope.

176
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,280
I spoke to a few people as I was walking into work

177
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,200
this morning and they asked me if I was a journalist.

178
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
I said, yes, I am.

179
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,680
And they said, are you happy about Pope Leo?

180
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,840
And I said, yes, are you?

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,640
And they all unanimously said to me, yes, we are so happy.

182
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,920
We're so excited.

183
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,000
And that really is the feeling that one gets

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,920
from walking around within St. Peter's Basilica

185
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
and the area around the Vatican.

186
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,600
There is such a feeling of hope, of renewal,

187
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,000
of a look towards the future for the Roman Catholic Church.
