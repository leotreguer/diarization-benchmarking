0	1520	We're going to head straight to the Vatican.
1520	5120	My colleague Marion Machiri is standing by, Marion.
8280	10280	Lewis, thank you very much indeed.
10280	12120	Yes, welcome to the Vatican,
12120	15800	where Pope Leo XIV has been celebrating mass
15800	17880	with cardinals at the Sistine Chapel
17880	20240	following his election on Thursday.
26160	28040	These are the recent pictures of the new pope
28080	31480	entering the Sistine Chapel leading his first mass as pontiff.
31480	33840	He began his homily in English,
33840	36600	saying he knew he could rely on every cardinal
36600	38800	to walk with him on his new mission.
38800	40840	The pope has said the church must do more work
40840	42800	in places where there is a lack of faith
42800	44720	and said that he hopes his election
44720	46280	can help the Catholic Church
46280	49280	bring light to the dark nights of this world.
49280	52840	Well, Pope Leo will be the 267th occupant
52840	54360	of the throne of Saint Peter.
54360	57640	So what do we know about the first American
57640	59600	to fill the role of pope?
59600	61800	Well, 69-year-old Pope Leo XIV
61800	65320	was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago
65320	69080	to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent.
69080	71080	He was ordained in 1982
71080	73640	and moved to Peru three years later.
73640	76680	He then became a naturalised Peruvian citizen
76680	79680	spending 10 years as a local parish pastor
79680	83080	and teaching at a seminary in northwestern Peru.
83080	85360	He became well-known to cardinals in the Vatican
85360	87200	because of his high-profile role
87200	90160	as prefect of the Dicastery for bishops.
90160	93920	Pope Francis made him the bishop of Checleo in Peru in 2014
93920	98360	and then he became archbishop in January 2023.
98360	102520	Within a few months, Pope Francis had made him a cardinal.
102520	104120	Well, joining me here is Anna Rowlands,
104120	106120	professor of Catholic social thought and practice
106120	107040	at Durham University,
107040	110080	who's been on succumbment to the Vatican for two years.
110080	113760	And I have to say, you met the new pope last night.
113760	114880	What was that like?
114880	117280	I did, which was a surprise and an accident.
117280	118520	How was it an accident?
118520	120360	How does one meet the pope accidentally?
120360	123080	Well, my colleague, who's a very senior woman in the Vatican,
123080	124600	one of the most senior women in the Vatican
124600	125960	to be appointed by Pope Francis,
125960	128640	was charging at high speed across St Peter's Square
128640	131480	and I bumped into her and she said to me, run.
131480	132320	And I said, why?
132320	133160	And she said, just run.
133160	135360	So at that point I realised I was following her back
135360	138200	to the palazzo that's just behind where we're talking now
138200	140960	and that's where she lives in one of the apartments
140960	143760	and where the former Cardinal Prevost lived as well.
143760	146160	So rather sweetly, just as Pope Francis had gone back
146160	149720	to pay his bill at the guest house just after he became pope,
149720	152640	Pope Leo XIV went back to the community
152640	155800	in the palazzo where he lives to greet people personally,
155800	158720	to give them a blessing and to spend a little time,
158720	160320	to spend a little time talking.
160320	161160	There you are.
161160	162400	That's sister Natalie as well.
162400	163240	There you are speaking to him.
163240	164440	And what did he say to you?
164440	167360	So, well, I had a chance to congratulate him
167360	169080	and also to assure him of prayers,
169080	172680	but also to thank him in particular for the powerful words
172680	174240	that he spoke from the balcony
174240	176480	and to express the gratitude on behalf of the crowd.
176480	177920	So many of that crowd would have loved
177920	179440	to have had the chance that I had last night
179440	180600	to greet him personally.
180600	183320	So I felt responsible to bring him the gratitude
183320	184640	and the joy of that crowd.
184640	186080	What were the powerful words
186080	187960	that stuck out for you from last night?
187960	191800	So peace, nine times he mentioned the word peace
191800	194120	and he wants to be a peace builder, a bridge builder,
194120	196080	he said, both for the church,
196080	199560	whether a divisions in the church, but also for the world.
199560	201760	The second key message was love,
201800	205480	the completely unconditional love of God for all people.
205480	207080	And he talked about bringing peace and love
207080	210320	for the whole of humanity, but also for the whole earth.
210320	213880	So that message very much from Benedict and Francis
213880	216480	that's focused on our climactic situation
216480	219480	as well as our kind of human situation of brokenness.
219480	222720	So I think he wants to focus on peace building
222720	226480	on a kind of unifying project, overcoming polarization
226480	230680	and to be basically a pope of a just peace for our times.
230720	234400	Will he succeed given the geopolitical headwinds,
234400	236320	given the way in which the Catholic church
236320	238200	has been moving over the last few years?
238200	240000	Yes, I think that there's a very good chance he will.
240000	243880	He came out dressed like Benedict, speaking like Francis.
243880	245960	That was the first sign of, I think,
245960	248120	his unifying mission to thread together,
248120	250000	literally in the threads he was wearing,
250000	252360	to thread together these papacies.
252360	253520	And I think that for the church
253520	256240	is very significant as a sign for the world,
256240	257360	also an important sign.
257360	258960	His first visit, as I understand it,
258960	261920	outside the Vatican will be to the Regina Chaly prison
261920	263440	just down the road from here.
263440	264280	Interesting.
264280	265280	Yeah, he's an Augustinian,
265280	267800	so he brings that focus on intellectual life,
267800	271080	but also service of the poorest and the most marginalized.
271080	273560	That is a heady, literally, combination.
273560	276520	And I think very interesting to have an Augustinian pope
276520	279240	for a moment when, as we saw the other month,
279240	282880	JD Vance quoting St. Augustine on Christian nationalism.
282880	285680	What will an Augustinian pope say to an Augustinian moment?
285680	286520	Well, what indeed.
286520	287680	Anna, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
287720	289520	Thank you very much for sharing your photos as well.
289520	290360	Not at all.
290360	292760	You and Pope Leo XIV.
292760	295360	Now, let me just, if I may, show viewers at home
295360	298600	some of the Italian newspapers from this morning.
298600	302200	And unsurprisingly, all of them showing
302200	303720	the new pope on the front page.
303720	306280	This is Il Giornale, Leone d'America,
306280	310080	The Lion of America, a play on the pope's name.
311200	313080	La pace sia con te.
313080	314480	I don't know if you can see that
314480	316760	from the Avenida publication.
316800	318520	Peace be with us.
318520	319360	Sorry, con noi.
319360	320360	La pace sia con noi.
320360	321640	Peace be with us.
322520	324960	And here we have La Stampa.
326600	328480	Il Papa dei Due Mondi.
328480	330680	The pope of two worlds.
330680	332760	And I think a reference there to the fact
332760	336960	that Pope Leo is American-born, North American-born,
336960	339120	but also a naturalized Peruvian citizen.
339120	342240	So also has strong connections with Latin America.
342240	344600	And finally, La Repubblica.
344760	347960	Il Papa Americano, the American pope.
347960	349600	Absolutely brilliant front pages there.
349600	353360	All of them showing Pope Leo XIV on that balcony.
353360	356640	Well, Louis Prevost is the brother of Pope Leo.
356640	358920	He's spoken about the moment he found out
358920	362200	his sibling was the new head of the Roman Catholic Church.
362200	363040	Have a listen.
364120	367680	It was like, oh my God, it's Rob.
367680	369120	It's never gonna be the same.
369120	371160	What are we gonna do?
371160	372960	Yes, it's Rob, yeah, yeah.
373960	377080	I used to, I still do it, you know?
377080	379880	Play with guns, knives, bolts and arrows.
379880	381040	He would play priest.
381960	384320	How boring, come on, Rob, let's go.
384320	386400	No, can I give you communion?
389160	391400	And we'd just teach him, you're gonna be the pope.
391400	392600	You wanna be the pope.
392600	394240	Here we are today.
394240	397320	He knew from an early stage he wanted to be a priest.
398200	399400	And he did.
399400	402320	Got out of grammar school, went right to the seminary.
402520	406640	He was always like a servant to the people,
406640	409280	trying to help the people build churches down there
409280	410720	and schools.
410720	412520	He's more down the middle.
412520	417280	Okay, let's see how we can take what Francis did,
418360	420040	massage it a little bit.
420040	423640	As pope now, he's just reinforcing the fact
423640	428640	that God and Jesus said, follow me and you'll be saved.
429400	432880	You'll be saved, evil will not win.
436040	438920	That's the brother of Pope Leo XIV.
438920	442160	And the mood, the atmosphere here in the Vatican
442160	443600	is one of such hope.
443600	446280	I spoke to a few people as I was walking into work
446280	449200	this morning and they asked me if I was a journalist.
449200	450040	I said, yes, I am.
450040	452680	And they said, are you happy about Pope Leo?
452680	453840	And I said, yes, are you?
453840	457640	And they all unanimously said to me, yes, we are so happy.
457640	458920	We're so excited.
458920	462000	And that really is the feeling that one gets
462000	465920	from walking around within St. Peter's Basilica
465920	467920	and the area around the Vatican.
467920	470600	There is such a feeling of hope, of renewal,
470600	474000	of a look towards the future for the Roman Catholic Church.
