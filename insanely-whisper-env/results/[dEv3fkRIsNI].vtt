WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
We're going to head straight to the Vatican.

00:01.520 --> 00:05.120
My colleague Marion Machiri is standing by, Marion.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.280
Lewis, thank you very much indeed.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.120
Yes, welcome to the Vatican,

00:12.120 --> 00:15.800
where Pope Leo XIV has been celebrating mass

00:15.800 --> 00:17.880
with cardinals at the Sistine Chapel

00:17.880 --> 00:20.240
following his election on Thursday.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.040
These are the recent pictures of the new pope

00:28.080 --> 00:31.480
entering the Sistine Chapel leading his first mass as pontiff.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.840
He began his homily in English,

00:33.840 --> 00:36.600
saying he knew he could rely on every cardinal

00:36.600 --> 00:38.800
to walk with him on his new mission.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.840
The pope has said the church must do more work

00:40.840 --> 00:42.800
in places where there is a lack of faith

00:42.800 --> 00:44.720
and said that he hopes his election

00:44.720 --> 00:46.280
can help the Catholic Church

00:46.280 --> 00:49.280
bring light to the dark nights of this world.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.840
Well, Pope Leo will be the 267th occupant

00:52.840 --> 00:54.360
of the throne of Saint Peter.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.640
So what do we know about the first American

00:57.640 --> 00:59.600
to fill the role of pope?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.800
Well, 69-year-old Pope Leo XIV

01:01.800 --> 01:05.320
was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago

01:05.320 --> 01:09.080
to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.080
He was ordained in 1982

01:11.080 --> 01:13.640
and moved to Peru three years later.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.680
He then became a naturalised Peruvian citizen

01:16.680 --> 01:19.680
spending 10 years as a local parish pastor

01:19.680 --> 01:23.080
and teaching at a seminary in northwestern Peru.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.360
He became well-known to cardinals in the Vatican

01:25.360 --> 01:27.200
because of his high-profile role

01:27.200 --> 01:30.160
as prefect of the Dicastery for bishops.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.920
Pope Francis made him the bishop of Checleo in Peru in 2014

01:33.920 --> 01:38.360
and then he became archbishop in January 2023.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.520
Within a few months, Pope Francis had made him a cardinal.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.120
Well, joining me here is Anna Rowlands,

01:44.120 --> 01:46.120
professor of Catholic social thought and practice

01:46.120 --> 01:47.040
at Durham University,

01:47.040 --> 01:50.080
who's been on succumbment to the Vatican for two years.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.760
And I have to say, you met the new pope last night.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.880
What was that like?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.280
I did, which was a surprise and an accident.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.520
How was it an accident?

01:58.520 --> 02:00.360
How does one meet the pope accidentally?

02:00.360 --> 02:03.080
Well, my colleague, who's a very senior woman in the Vatican,

02:03.080 --> 02:04.600
one of the most senior women in the Vatican

02:04.600 --> 02:05.960
to be appointed by Pope Francis,

02:05.960 --> 02:08.640
was charging at high speed across St Peter's Square

02:08.640 --> 02:11.480
and I bumped into her and she said to me, run.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.320
And I said, why?

02:12.320 --> 02:13.160
And she said, just run.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.360
So at that point I realised I was following her back

02:15.360 --> 02:18.200
to the palazzo that's just behind where we're talking now

02:18.200 --> 02:20.960
and that's where she lives in one of the apartments

02:20.960 --> 02:23.760
and where the former Cardinal Prevost lived as well.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.160
So rather sweetly, just as Pope Francis had gone back

02:26.160 --> 02:29.720
to pay his bill at the guest house just after he became pope,

02:29.720 --> 02:32.640
Pope Leo XIV went back to the community

02:32.640 --> 02:35.800
in the palazzo where he lives to greet people personally,

02:35.800 --> 02:38.720
to give them a blessing and to spend a little time,

02:38.720 --> 02:40.320
to spend a little time talking.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.160
There you are.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.400
That's sister Natalie as well.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.240
There you are speaking to him.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.440
And what did he say to you?

02:44.440 --> 02:47.360
So, well, I had a chance to congratulate him

02:47.360 --> 02:49.080
and also to assure him of prayers,

02:49.080 --> 02:52.680
but also to thank him in particular for the powerful words

02:52.680 --> 02:54.240
that he spoke from the balcony

02:54.240 --> 02:56.480
and to express the gratitude on behalf of the crowd.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.920
So many of that crowd would have loved

02:57.920 --> 02:59.440
to have had the chance that I had last night

02:59.440 --> 03:00.600
to greet him personally.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.320
So I felt responsible to bring him the gratitude

03:03.320 --> 03:04.640
and the joy of that crowd.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.080
What were the powerful words

03:06.080 --> 03:07.960
that stuck out for you from last night?

03:07.960 --> 03:11.800
So peace, nine times he mentioned the word peace

03:11.800 --> 03:14.120
and he wants to be a peace builder, a bridge builder,

03:14.120 --> 03:16.080
he said, both for the church,

03:16.080 --> 03:19.560
whether a divisions in the church, but also for the world.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.760
The second key message was love,

03:21.800 --> 03:25.480
the completely unconditional love of God for all people.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.080
And he talked about bringing peace and love

03:27.080 --> 03:30.320
for the whole of humanity, but also for the whole earth.

03:30.320 --> 03:33.880
So that message very much from Benedict and Francis

03:33.880 --> 03:36.480
that's focused on our climactic situation

03:36.480 --> 03:39.480
as well as our kind of human situation of brokenness.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.720
So I think he wants to focus on peace building

03:42.720 --> 03:46.480
on a kind of unifying project, overcoming polarization

03:46.480 --> 03:50.680
and to be basically a pope of a just peace for our times.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.400
Will he succeed given the geopolitical headwinds,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.320
given the way in which the Catholic church

03:56.320 --> 03:58.200
has been moving over the last few years?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.000
Yes, I think that there's a very good chance he will.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.880
He came out dressed like Benedict, speaking like Francis.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.960
That was the first sign of, I think,

04:05.960 --> 04:08.120
his unifying mission to thread together,

04:08.120 --> 04:10.000
literally in the threads he was wearing,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.360
to thread together these papacies.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.520
And I think that for the church

04:13.520 --> 04:16.240
is very significant as a sign for the world,

04:16.240 --> 04:17.360
also an important sign.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.960
His first visit, as I understand it,

04:18.960 --> 04:21.920
outside the Vatican will be to the Regina Chaly prison

04:21.920 --> 04:23.440
just down the road from here.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.280
Interesting.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.280
Yeah, he's an Augustinian,

04:25.280 --> 04:27.800
so he brings that focus on intellectual life,

04:27.800 --> 04:31.080
but also service of the poorest and the most marginalized.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.560
That is a heady, literally, combination.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.520
And I think very interesting to have an Augustinian pope

04:36.520 --> 04:39.240
for a moment when, as we saw the other month,

04:39.240 --> 04:42.880
JD Vance quoting St. Augustine on Christian nationalism.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.680
What will an Augustinian pope say to an Augustinian moment?

04:45.680 --> 04:46.520
Well, what indeed.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.680
Anna, it's a pleasure to talk to you.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.520
Thank you very much for sharing your photos as well.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.360
Not at all.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.760
You and Pope Leo XIV.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.360
Now, let me just, if I may, show viewers at home

04:55.360 --> 04:58.600
some of the Italian newspapers from this morning.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.200
And unsurprisingly, all of them showing

05:02.200 --> 05:03.720
the new pope on the front page.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.280
This is Il Giornale, Leone d'America,

05:06.280 --> 05:10.080
The Lion of America, a play on the pope's name.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.080
La pace sia con te.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.480
I don't know if you can see that

05:14.480 --> 05:16.760
from the Avenida publication.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.520
Peace be with us.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.360
Sorry, con noi.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
La pace sia con noi.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.640
Peace be with us.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.960
And here we have La Stampa.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.480
Il Papa dei Due Mondi.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.680
The pope of two worlds.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.760
And I think a reference there to the fact

05:32.760 --> 05:36.960
that Pope Leo is American-born, North American-born,

05:36.960 --> 05:39.120
but also a naturalized Peruvian citizen.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.240
So also has strong connections with Latin America.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.600
And finally, La Repubblica.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.960
Il Papa Americano, the American pope.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.600
Absolutely brilliant front pages there.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.360
All of them showing Pope Leo XIV on that balcony.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.640
Well, Louis Prevost is the brother of Pope Leo.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.920
He's spoken about the moment he found out

05:58.920 --> 06:02.200
his sibling was the new head of the Roman Catholic Church.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.040
Have a listen.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.680
It was like, oh my God, it's Rob.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.120
It's never gonna be the same.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.160
What are we gonna do?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.960
Yes, it's Rob, yeah, yeah.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.080
I used to, I still do it, you know?

06:17.080 --> 06:19.880
Play with guns, knives, bolts and arrows.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.040
He would play priest.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.320
How boring, come on, Rob, let's go.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.400
No, can I give you communion?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.400
And we'd just teach him, you're gonna be the pope.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.600
You wanna be the pope.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.240
Here we are today.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.320
He knew from an early stage he wanted to be a priest.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.400
And he did.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.320
Got out of grammar school, went right to the seminary.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.640
He was always like a servant to the people,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.280
trying to help the people build churches down there

06:49.280 --> 06:50.720
and schools.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.520
He's more down the middle.

06:52.520 --> 06:57.280
Okay, let's see how we can take what Francis did,

06:58.360 --> 07:00.040
massage it a little bit.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.640
As pope now, he's just reinforcing the fact

07:03.640 --> 07:08.640
that God and Jesus said, follow me and you'll be saved.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.880
You'll be saved, evil will not win.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.920
That's the brother of Pope Leo XIV.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.160
And the mood, the atmosphere here in the Vatican

07:22.160 --> 07:23.600
is one of such hope.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.280
I spoke to a few people as I was walking into work

07:26.280 --> 07:29.200
this morning and they asked me if I was a journalist.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.040
I said, yes, I am.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.680
And they said, are you happy about Pope Leo?

07:32.680 --> 07:33.840
And I said, yes, are you?

07:33.840 --> 07:37.640
And they all unanimously said to me, yes, we are so happy.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.920
We're so excited.

07:38.920 --> 07:42.000
And that really is the feeling that one gets

07:42.000 --> 07:45.920
from walking around within St. Peter's Basilica

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
and the area around the Vatican.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.600
There is such a feeling of hope, of renewal,

07:50.600 --> 07:54.000
of a look towards the future for the Roman Catholic Church.
