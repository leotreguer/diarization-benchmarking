Yes, welcome to the Vatican, where Pope Leo XIV has today been celebrating Mass with cardinals at the Sistine Chapel following his election on Thursday. These are the recent pictures of the new Pope entering the Sistine Chapel, leading his first mass as pontiff. He began his homily in English, saying he knew he could rely on every cardinal to walk with him on his new mission. The Pope has said the Church must do more work in places where there is a lack of faith and said that he hopes his election can help the Catholic Church bring light to the dark nights of this world. Well, Pope Leo will be the 267th occupant of the throne of Saint Peter. So what do we know about the first American to fill the role of Pope? Well, 69-year-old Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Provost in Chicago to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent. He was ordained in 1982 and moved to Peru three years later. He then became a naturalised Peruvian citizen, spending ten years as a local parish pastor and teaching at a seminary in north-western Peru. He became well-known to cardinals in the Vatican because of his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. Pope Francis made him the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru in 2014 and then he became Archbishop in January 2023. Within a few months Pope Francis had made him a cardinal. Well joining me here is Anna Rowlands, Professor of Catholic Social Thought and Practice at Durham University, who's been on succumbent to the Vatican for two years. And I have to say, you met the new Pope last night. What was that like? I did, which was a surprise and an accident, I have to say. How was it an accident? How does one meet the Pope accidentally? Well, my colleague, who's a very senior woman in the Vatican, one of the most senior women in the Vatican to be appointed by Pope Francis, was charging at high speed across St. Peter's Square. And I bumped into her and she said to me, run. And I said, why? And she said, just run. So at that point, I realised I was following her back to the Palazzo that's just behind where we're talking now. And that's where she lives in one of the apartments and where the former Cardinal Prevost lived as well. So rather sweetly, just as Pope Francis had gone back to pay his bill at the guest house just after he became Pope, Pope Leo XIV went back to the community in the Palazzo where he lives to greet people personally, to give them a blessing and to spend a little time talking. That's Sister Natalie as well. There you are speaking to him. What did he say to you? So, well, I had a chance to congratulate him and also to assure him of prayers, but also to thank him in particular for the powerful words that he spoke from the balcony and to express the gratitude on behalf of the crowd. So many of that crowd would have loved to have had the chance I had last night to greet him personally. So I felt responsible to bring him the gratitude and the joy of that crowd. What were the powerful words that stuck out for you from last night? So peace. Nine times he mentioned the word peace. And he wants to be a peace builder, a bridge builder, he said, both for the church, where there are divisions in the church, but also for the world. The second key message was love, the completely unconditional love of God for all people. And he talked about bringing peace and love for the whole of humanity, but also for the whole earth. So that message very much from Benedict and Francis that's focused on our climactic situation, as well as our kind of human situation of brokenness. So I think he wants to focus on peace building, on a kind of unifying project, overcoming polarisation and to be basically a pope of a just peace for our times. Powerful. Will he succeed given the geopolitical headwinds, given the way in which the Catholic Church has been moving over the last few years? Yes, I think that there's a very good chance he will. He came out dressed like Benedict, speaking like Francis. That was the first sign of, I think, his unifying mission to thread together, literally in the threads he was wearing, to thread together these papacies. And I think that for the church is very significant as a sign for the world, also an important sign. His first visit, as I understand it, outside the Vatican will be to the Regina Caeli prison just down the road from here. Oh, interesting. Yeah, he's an Augustinian, so he brings that focus on intellectual life, but also service of the poorest and the most marginalised. That is a heady, literally, combination, and I think very interesting to have an Augustinian pope for a moment when, as we saw the other month, J.D.
